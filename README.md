## 🌟  Overview

This project uses a recommendation system to suggest anime titles based on user preferences such as:
- Genre (Action, Comedy, Romance, etc.)
- Popularity
- Ratings
- Similarity to previously watched anime

The goal is to make finding your next favorite anime easier and more personalized.

## 🧠 How It Works

The recommendation engine combines:
1. **Content-Based Filtering** — suggests anime with similar genres, themes, or studios.
2. **Collaborative Filtering** — uses user ratings to find patterns and similar taste profiles.
3. **Hybrid Recommendation Model** — combines both methods for better accuracy.
